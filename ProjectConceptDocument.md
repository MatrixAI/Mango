##Problem Statement
People do not have an easy way to run their own services such as file sharing, social networking, email services, chat services, photo sharing services, video playing service, time tracking services, note taking, document management services, search engine services. 

##Vision
We wish to reduce the barrier of entry, and run our own services. Pocket server with preconfigured utilities so non-technical people can use it immediately.
