#Theory on the personal server
This is a list of websites and journal articles to explain the personal server. 
It also includes websites of competitors or similar products useful to the *Mango*.

[Brief explanation on what is a server.] (http://www.techterms.com/definition/server) 

[Short introduction to the personal server.] (https://citizenweb.is/guide/srv/1-why)

Key points:
+ Data given to platform services like Google or Facebook risks being handed to other people without your consent
+ When data is self-hosted and properly secured, you can control the distribution of your personal information
+ Hosting your own server can be complicated to implement:
    + You must be your own security expert
    + Your home server can be subjected to downtime (e.g. power outages)
    + Must have a back up in case your home server is down
+ Types of servers: 
    + Dedicated Server (a standard computer in your home that is connected to the Internet and/or a home network)
    + Embedded Miniserver (Raspberry Pi) 
    + Virtual Private Server (VPS)

    Key Points:
      + Verifying that data exists only at allowed locations can be difficult. 
      + It requires the cloud customer to trust that their cloud provider is completely honest and open about where their servers are hosted and adhere strictly to service level agreements (SLAs).

##Our product philosophy will be similar to:

But, the *Mango* will have an extra layer of security. Dedicated hardware means you can protect after your server 24/7.
