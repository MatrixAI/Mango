# Filesystems brief
## Situation
We are currently using __ext4__ filesystem on or __MAN-00__ prototype.
Together with power cuts, it makes the SD card corruption-prone. 
Online backups don't really match our 'own-secure-server' product philosophy.

## Mission
Come up with a solution to minimise or eliminate this risk.

## Execution
Our current options are:
+ Select a different, more reliable filesystem (__BTRFS__, __ZFS__, see links in the _Situation_)
+ Implement an offline/secure backup solution
+ Cry and give up

We could also conduct a series of poweroff tests with different SD cards to determine wether newer cards have inbuilt ECC.
