#Features
A list of *Mango* services/modules/features, basically everything that'll be running on top of the basic system.  
*This is just an incomplete list of ideas, modification, discussion and expansion is strongly encouraged.*
##Technical
- Webserver (Apache, per say - since most of the 'modules' will be available through a web interface)
- Fileserver (Samba, if the users want to connect to the *Mango* directly)
- SSH server (for advanced users who want to configure the *Mango* directly)
- Streaming server (with a fancy web-interface to control it as a separate module)
- ?????
- PROFIT!!!

##Functional
All of these will be accessible through their respective sub-domains on the webserver.
- File storage/sharing/backup (e.g. ownCloud)
- Media streaming (?)
- Chat (IRC/P2P encrypted stuff for security freaks e.g. Iris, [Toxic](https://github.com/Tox/toxic))
- Clientless remote desktop server (Guacamole)
- Social networking (Disapora/Friendica/Freenet)
- P2P Networking (Commotion)
