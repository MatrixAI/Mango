WHY WE ARE NOT USING A MOBILE PHONE:
------------------------------------

    -> Expensive
    -> Fashion Item
    -> People don't want to leave this around
    -> It's important to them
    -> They are unlikely to carry multiple of these around
    -> Proprietary or non-standard operating systems
    -> Makes it difficult to run standardised programs
    -> Makes it difficult program
    -> BECAUSE ANDROID AND IPHONE ARE TOO COMPLEX. AND NON-STANDARD. AND ARE DESIGNED FOR PHONES, NOT PLAY THINGS.
    -> People don't think of their phones as simple disposable items that they leave anywhere.
    -> PHONES are connected to contracts. Linked as part of a sim relationship.
